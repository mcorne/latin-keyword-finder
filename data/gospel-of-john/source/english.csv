"1:1"	"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."
"1:2"	"He was in the beginning with God."
"1:3"	"All things came to be through him, and without him nothing came to be. What came to be"
"1:4"	"through him was life, and this life was the light of the human race;"
"1:5"	"the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it."
"1:6"	"A man named John was sent from God."
"1:7"	"He came for testimony, to testify to the light, so that all might believe through him."
"1:8"	"He was not the light, but came to testify to the light."
"1:9"	"The true light, which enlightens everyone, was coming into the world."
"1:10"	"He was in the world, and the world came to be through him, but the world did not know him."
"1:11"	"He came to what was his own, but his own people did not accept him."
"1:12"	"But to those who did accept him he gave power to become children of God, to those who believe in his name,"
"1:13"	"who were born not by natural generation nor by human choice nor by a man's decision but of God."
"1:14"	"And the Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us, and we saw his glory, the glory as of the Father's only Son, full of grace and truth."
"1:15"	"John testified to him and cried out, saying, ""This was he of whom I said, 'The one who is coming after me ranks ahead of me because he existed before me.'"""
"1:16"	"From his fullness we have all received, grace in place of grace,"
"1:17"	"because while the law was given through Moses, grace and truth came through Jesus Christ."
"1:18"	"No one has ever seen God. The only Son, God, who is at the Father's side, has revealed him."
"1:19"	"And this is the testimony of John. When the Jews from Jerusalem sent priests and Levites (to him) to ask him, ""Who are you?"""
"1:20"	"he admitted and did not deny it, but admitted, ""I am not the Messiah."""
"1:21"	"So they asked him, ""What are you then? Are you Elijah?"" And he said, ""I am not."" ""Are you the Prophet?"" He answered, ""No."""
"1:22"	"So they said to him, ""Who are you, so we can give an answer to those who sent us? What do you have to say for yourself?"""
"1:23"	"He said: ""I am 'the voice of one crying out in the desert, ""Make straight the way of the Lord,""' as Isaiah the prophet said."""
"1:24"	"Some Pharisees were also sent."
"1:25"	"They asked him, ""Why then do you baptize if you are not the Messiah or Elijah or the Prophet?"""
"1:26"	"John answered them, ""I baptize with water; but there is one among you whom you do not recognize,"
"1:27"	"the one who is coming after me, whose sandal strap I am not worthy to untie."""
"1:28"	"This happened in Bethany across the Jordan, where John was baptizing."
"1:29"	"The next day he saw Jesus coming toward him and said, ""Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world."
"1:30"	"He is the one of whom I said, 'A man is coming after me who ranks ahead of me because he existed before me.'"
"1:31"	"I did not know him, but the reason why I came baptizing with water was that he might be made known to Israel."""
"1:32"	"John testified further, saying, ""I saw the Spirit come down like a dove from the sky and remain upon him."
"1:33"	"I did not know him, but the one who sent me to baptize with water told me, 'On whomever you see the Spirit come down and remain, he is the one who will baptize with the holy Spirit.'"
"1:34"	"Now I have seen and testified that he is the Son of God."""
"1:35"	"The next day John was there again with two of his disciples,"
"1:36"	"and as he watched Jesus walk by, he said, ""Behold, the Lamb of God."""
"1:37"	"The two disciples heard what he said and followed Jesus."
"1:38"	"Jesus turned and saw them following him and said to them, ""What are you looking for?"" They said to him, ""Rabbi"" (which translated means Teacher), ""where are you staying?"""
"1:39"	"He said to them,""Come, and you will see."" So they went and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him that day. It was about four in the afternoon."
"1:40"	"Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, was one of the two who heard John and followed Jesus."
"1:41"	"He first found his own brother Simon and told him, ""We have found the Messiah"" (which is translated Anointed)."
"1:42"	"Then he brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, ""You are Simon the son of John; you will be called Kephas"" (which is translated Peter)."
"1:43"	"The next day he decided to go to Galilee, and he found Philip. And Jesus said to him, ""Follow me."""
"1:44"	"Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the town of Andrew and Peter."
"1:45"	"Philip found Nathanael and told him, ""We have found the one about whom Moses wrote in the law, and also the prophets, Jesus, son of Joseph, from Nazareth."""
"1:46"	"But Nathanael said to him, ""Can anything good come from Nazareth?"" Philip said to him, ""Come and see."""
"1:47"	"Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him and said of him, ""Here is a true Israelite. There is no duplicity in him."""
"1:48"	"Nathanael said to him, ""How do you know me?"" Jesus answered and said to him, ""Before Philip called you, I saw you under the fig tree."""
"1:49"	"Nathanael answered him, ""Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel."""
"1:50"	"Jesus answered and said to him, ""Do you believe because I told you that I saw you under the fig tree? You will see greater things than this."""
"1:51"	"And he said to him, ""Amen, amen, I say to you, you will see the sky opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man."""
"2:1"	"On the third day there was a wedding in Cana in Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there."
"2:2"	"Jesus and his disciples were also invited to the wedding."
"2:3"	"When the wine ran short, the mother of Jesus said to him, ""They have no wine."""
"2:4"	"(And) Jesus said to her, ""Woman, how does your concern affect me? My hour has not yet come."""
"2:5"	"His mother said to the servers, ""Do whatever he tells you."""
"2:6"	"Now there were six stone water jars there for Jewish ceremonial washings, each holding twenty to thirty gallons."
"2:7"	"Jesus told them, ""Fill the jars with water."" So they filled them to the brim."
"2:8"	"Then he told them, ""Draw some out now and take it to the headwaiter."" So they took it."
"2:9"	"And when the headwaiter tasted the water that had become wine, without knowing where it came from (although the servers who had drawn the water knew), the headwaiter called the bridegroom"
"2:10"	"and said to him, ""Everyone serves good wine first, and then when people have drunk freely, an inferior one; but you have kept the good wine until now."""
"2:11"	"Jesus did this as the beginning of his signs in Cana in Galilee and so revealed his glory, and his disciples began to believe in him."
"2:12"	"After this, he and his mother, (his) brothers, and his disciples went down to Capernaum and stayed there only a few days."
"2:13"	"Since the Passover of the Jews was near, Jesus went up to Jerusalem."
"2:14"	"He found in the temple area those who sold oxen, sheep, and doves, as well as the money-changers seated there."
"2:15"	"He made a whip out of cords and drove them all out of the temple area, with the sheep and oxen, and spilled the coins of the money-changers and overturned their tables,"
"2:16"	"and to those who sold doves he said, ""Take these out of here, and stop making my Father's house a marketplace."""
"2:17"	"His disciples recalled the words of scripture, ""Zeal for your house will consume me."""
"2:18"	"At this the Jews answered and said to him, ""What sign can you show us for doing this?"""
"2:19"	"Jesus answered and said to them, ""Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up."""
"2:20"	"The Jews said, ""This temple has been under construction for forty-six years, and you will raise it up in three days?"""
"2:21"	"But he was speaking about the temple of his body."
"2:22"	"Therefore, when he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this, and they came to believe the scripture and the word Jesus had spoken."
"2:23"	"While he was in Jerusalem for the feast of Passover, many began to believe in his name when they saw the signs he was doing."
"2:24"	"But Jesus would not trust himself to them because he knew them all,"
"2:25"	"and did not need anyone to testify about human nature. He himself understood it well."
"3:1"	"Now there was a Pharisee named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews."
"3:2"	"He came to Jesus at night and said to him, ""Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher who has come from God, for no one can do these signs that you are doing unless God is with him."""
"3:3"	"Jesus answered and said to him, ""Amen, amen, I say to you, no one can see the kingdom of God without being born from above."""
"3:4"	"Nicodemus said to him, ""How can a person once grown old be born again? Surely he cannot reenter his mother's womb and be born again, can he?"""
"3:5"	"Jesus answered, ""Amen, amen, I say to you, no one can enter the kingdom of God without being born of water and Spirit."
"3:6"	"What is born of flesh is flesh and what is born of spirit is spirit."
"3:7"	"Do not be amazed that I told you, 'You must be born from above.'"
"3:8"	"The wind blows where it wills, and you can hear the sound it makes, but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes; so it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit."""
"3:9"	"Nicodemus answered and said to him, ""How can this happen?"""
"3:10"	"Jesus answered and said to him, ""You are the teacher of Israel and you do not understand this?"
"3:11"	"Amen, amen, I say to you, we speak of what we know and we testify to what we have seen, but you people do not accept our testimony."
"3:12"	"If I tell you about earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you about heavenly things?"
"3:13"	"No one has gone up to heaven except the one who has come down from heaven, the Son of Man."
"3:14"	"And just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the desert, so must the Son of Man be lifted up,"
"3:15"	"so that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life."""
"3:16"	"For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him might not perish but might have eternal life."
"3:17"	"For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through him."
"3:18"	"Whoever believes in him will not be condemned, but whoever does not believe has already been condemned, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God."
"3:19"	"And this is the verdict, that the light came into the world, but people preferred darkness to light, because their works were evil."
"3:20"	"For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come toward the light, so that his works might not be exposed."
"3:21"	"But whoever lives the truth comes to the light, so that his works may be clearly seen as done in God."
"3:22"	"After this, Jesus and his disciples went into the region of Judea, where he spent some time with them baptizing."
"3:23"	"John was also baptizing in Aenon near Salim, because there was an abundance of water there, and people came to be baptized,"
"3:24"	"for John had not yet been imprisoned."
"3:25"	"Now a dispute arose between the disciples of John and a Jew about ceremonial washings."
"3:26"	"So they came to John and said to him, ""Rabbi, the one who was with you across the Jordan, to whom you testified, here he is baptizing and everyone is coming to him."""
"3:27"	"John answered and said, ""No one can receive anything except what has been given him from heaven."
"3:28"	"You yourselves can testify that I said (that) I am not the Messiah, but that I was sent before him."
"3:29"	"The one who has the bride is the bridegroom; the best man, who stands and listens for him, rejoices greatly at the bridegroom's voice. So this joy of mine has been made complete."
"3:30"	"He must increase; I must decrease."""
"3:31"	"The one who comes from above is above all. The one who is of the earth is earthly and speaks of earthly things. But the one who comes from heaven (is above all)."
"3:32"	"He testifies to what he has seen and heard, but no one accepts his testimony."
"3:33"	"Whoever does accept his testimony certifies that God is trustworthy."
"3:34"	"For the one whom God sent speaks the words of God. He does not ration his gift of the Spirit."
"3:35"	"The Father loves the Son and has given everything over to him."
"3:36"	"Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever disobeys the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God remains upon him."
"4:1"	"Now when Jesus learned that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John"
"4:2"	"(although Jesus himself was not baptizing, just his disciples),"
"4:3"	"he left Judea and returned to Galilee."
"4:4"	"He had to pass through Samaria."
"4:5"	"So he came to a town of Samaria called Sychar, near the plot of land that Jacob had given to his son Joseph."
"4:6"	"Jacob's well was there. Jesus, tired from his journey, sat down there at the well. It was about noon."
"4:7"	"A woman of Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her, ""Give me a drink."""
"4:8"	"His disciples had gone into the town to buy food."
"4:9"	"The Samaritan woman said to him, ""How can you, a Jew, ask me, a Samaritan woman, for a drink?"" (For Jews use nothing in common with Samaritans.)"
"4:10"	"Jesus answered and said to her, ""If you knew the gift of God and who is saying to you, 'Give me a drink,' you would have asked him and he would have given you living water."""
"4:11"	"(The woman) said to him, ""Sir, you do not even have a bucket and the cistern is deep; where then can you get this living water?"
"4:12"	"Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us this cistern and drank from it himself with his children and his flocks?"""
"4:13"	"Jesus answered and said to her, ""Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again;"
"4:14"	"but whoever drinks the water I shall give will never thirst; the water I shall give will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life."""
"4:15"	"The woman said to him, ""Sir, give me this water, so that I may not be thirsty or have to keep coming here to draw water."""
"4:16"	"Jesus said to her, ""Go call your husband and come back."""
"4:17"	"The woman answered and said to him, ""I do not have a husband."" Jesus answered her, ""You are right in saying, 'I do not have a husband.'"
"4:18"	"For you have had five husbands, and the one you have now is not your husband. What you have said is true."""
"4:19"	"The woman said to him, ""Sir, I can see that you are a prophet."
"4:20"	"Our ancestors worshiped on this mountain; but you people say that the place to worship is in Jerusalem."""
"4:21"	"Jesus said to her, ""Believe me, woman, the hour is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem."
"4:22"	"You people worship what you do not understand; we worship what we understand, because salvation is from the Jews."
"4:23"	"But the hour is coming, and is now here, when true worshipers will worship the Father in Spirit and truth; and indeed the Father seeks such people to worship him."
"4:24"	"God is Spirit, and those who worship him must worship in Spirit and truth."""
"4:25"	"The woman said to him, ""I know that the Messiah is coming, the one called the Anointed; when he comes, he will tell us everything."""
"4:26"	"Jesus said to her, ""I am he, the one who is speaking with you."""
"4:27"	"At that moment his disciples returned, and were amazed that he was talking with a woman, but still no one said, ""What are you looking for?"" or ""Why are you talking with her?"""
"4:28"	"The woman left her water jar and went into the town and said to the people,"
"4:29"	"""Come see a man who told me everything I have done. Could he possibly be the Messiah?"""
"4:30"	"They went out of the town and came to him."
"4:31"	"Meanwhile, the disciples urged him, ""Rabbi, eat."""
"4:32"	"But he said to them, ""I have food to eat of which you do not know."""
"4:33"	"So the disciples said to one another, ""Could someone have brought him something to eat?"""
"4:34"	"Jesus said to them, ""My food is to do the will of the one who sent me and to finish his work."
"4:35"	"Do you not say, 'In four months the harvest will be here'? I tell you, look up and see the fields ripe for the harvest."
"4:36"	"The reaper is already receiving his payment and gathering crops for eternal life, so that the sower and reaper can rejoice together."
"4:37"	"For here the saying is verified that 'One sows and another reaps.'"
"4:38"	"I sent you to reap what you have not worked for; others have done the work, and you are sharing the fruits of their work."""
"4:39"	"Many of the Samaritans of that town began to believe in him because of the word of the woman who testified, ""He told me everything I have done."""
"4:40"	"When the Samaritans came to him, they invited him to stay with them; and he stayed there two days."
"4:41"	"Many more began to believe in him because of his word,"
"4:42"	"and they said to the woman, ""We no longer believe because of your word; for we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this is truly the savior of the world."""
"4:43"	"After the two days, he left there for Galilee."
"4:44"	"For Jesus himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his native place."
"4:45"	"When he came into Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him, since they had seen all he had done in Jerusalem at the feast; for they themselves had gone to the feast."
"4:46"	"Then he returned to Cana in Galilee, where he had made the water wine. Now there was a royal official whose son was ill in Capernaum."
"4:47"	"When he heard that Jesus had arrived in Galilee from Judea, he went to him and asked him to come down and heal his son, who was near death."
"4:48"	"Jesus said to him, ""Unless you people see signs and wonders, you will not believe."""
"4:49"	"The royal official said to him, ""Sir, come down before my child dies."""
"4:50"	"Jesus said to him, ""You may go; your son will live."" The man believed what Jesus said to him and left."
"4:51"	"While he was on his way back, his slaves met him and told him that his boy would live."
"4:52"	"He asked them when he began to recover. They told him, ""The fever left him yesterday, about one in the afternoon."""
"4:53"	"The father realized that just at that time Jesus had said to him, ""Your son will live,"" and he and his whole household came to believe."
"4:54"	"(Now) this was the second sign Jesus did when he came to Galilee from Judea."
"5:1"	"After this, there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem."
"5:2"	"Now there is in Jerusalem at the Sheep (Gate) a pool called in Hebrew Bethesda, with five porticoes."
"5:3"	"In these lay a large number of ill, blind, lame, and crippled."
"5:4"	
"5:5"	"One man was there who had been ill for thirty-eight years."
"5:6"	"When Jesus saw him lying there and knew that he had been ill for a long time, he said to him, ""Do you want to be well?"""
"5:7"	"The sick man answered him, ""Sir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up; while I am on my way, someone else gets down there before me."""
"5:8"	"Jesus said to him, ""Rise, take up your mat, and walk."""
"5:9"	"Immediately the man became well, took up his mat, and walked. Now that day was a sabbath."
"5:10"	"So the Jews said to the man who was cured, ""It is the sabbath, and it is not lawful for you to carry your mat."""
"5:11"	"He answered them, ""The man who made me well told me, 'Take up your mat and walk.'"""
"5:12"	"They asked him, ""Who is the man who told you, 'Take it up and walk'?"""
"5:13"	"The man who was healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had slipped away, since there was a crowd there."
"5:14"	"After this Jesus found him in the temple area and said to him, ""Look, you are well; do not sin any more, so that nothing worse may happen to you."""
"5:15"	"The man went and told the Jews that Jesus was the one who had made him well."
"5:16"	"Therefore, the Jews began to persecute Jesus because he did this on a sabbath."
"5:17"	"But Jesus answered them, ""My Father is at work until now, so I am at work."""
"5:18"	"For this reason the Jews tried all the more to kill him, because he not only broke the sabbath but he also called God his own father, making himself equal to God."
"5:19"	"Jesus answered and said to them, ""Amen, amen, I say to you, a son cannot do anything on his own, but only what he sees his father doing; for what he does, his son will do also."
"5:20"	"For the Father loves his Son and shows him everything that he himself does, and he will show him greater works than these, so that you may be amazed."
"5:21"	"For just as the Father raises the dead and gives life, so also does the Son give life to whomever he wishes."
"5:22"	"Nor does the Father judge anyone, but he has given all judgment to his Son,"
"5:23"	"so that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him."
"5:24"	"Amen, amen, I say to you, whoever hears my word and believes in the one who sent me has eternal life and will not come to condemnation, but has passed from death to life."
"5:25"	"Amen, amen, I say to you, the hour is coming and is now here when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live."
"5:26"	"For just as the Father has life in himself, so also he gave to his Son the possession of life in himself."
"5:27"	"And he gave him power to exercise judgment, because he is the Son of Man."
"5:28"	"Do not be amazed at this, because the hour is coming in which all who are in the tombs will hear his voice"
"5:29"	"and will come out, those who have done good deeds to the resurrection of life, but those who have done wicked deeds to the resurrection of condemnation."
"5:30"	"""I cannot do anything on my own; I judge as I hear, and my judgment is just, because I do not seek my own will but the will of the one who sent me."
"5:31"	"""If I testify on my own behalf, my testimony cannot be verified."
"5:32"	"But there is another who testifies on my behalf, and I know that the testimony he gives on my behalf is true."
"5:33"	"You sent emissaries to John, and he testified to the truth."
"5:34"	"I do not accept testimony from a human being, but I say this so that you may be saved."
"5:35"	"He was a burning and shining lamp, and for a while you were content to rejoice in his light."
"5:36"	"But I have testimony greater than John's. The works that the Father gave me to accomplish, these works that I perform testify on my behalf that the Father has sent me."
"5:37"	"Moreover, the Father who sent me has testified on my behalf. But you have never heard his voice nor seen his form,"
"5:38"	"and you do not have his word remaining in you, because you do not believe in the one whom he has sent."
"5:39"	"You search the scriptures, because you think you have eternal life through them; even they testify on my behalf."
"5:40"	"But you do not want to come to me to have life."
"5:41"	"""I do not accept human praise;"
"5:42"	"moreover, I know that you do not have the love of God in you."
"5:43"	"I came in the name of my Father, but you do not accept me; yet if another comes in his own name, you will accept him."
"5:44"	"How can you believe, when you accept praise from one another and do not seek the praise that comes from the only God?"
"5:45"	"Do not think that I will accuse you before the Father: the one who will accuse you is Moses, in whom you have placed your hope."
"5:46"	"For if you had believed Moses, you would have believed me, because he wrote about me."
"5:47"	"But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe my words?"""
"6:1"	"After this, Jesus went across the Sea of Galilee (of Tiberias)."
"6:2"	"A large crowd followed him, because they saw the signs he was performing on the sick."
"6:3"	"Jesus went up on the mountain, and there he sat down with his disciples."
"6:4"	"The Jewish feast of Passover was near."
"6:5"	"When Jesus raised his eyes and saw that a large crowd was coming to him, he said to Philip, ""Where can we buy enough food for them to eat?"""
"6:6"	"He said this to test him, because he himself knew what he was going to do."
"6:7"	"Philip answered him, ""Two hundred days' wages worth of food would not be enough for each of them to have a little (bit)."""
"6:8"	"One of his disciples, Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, said to him,"
"6:9"	"""There is a boy here who has five barley loaves and two fish; but what good are these for so many?"""
"6:10"	"Jesus said, ""Have the people recline."" Now there was a great deal of grass in that place. So the men reclined, about five thousand in number."
"6:11"	"Then Jesus took the loaves, gave thanks, and distributed them to those who were reclining, and also as much of the fish as they wanted."
"6:12"	"When they had had their fill, he said to his disciples, ""Gather the fragments left over, so that nothing will be wasted."""
"6:13"	"So they collected them, and filled twelve wicker baskets with fragments from the five barley loaves that had been more than they could eat."
"6:14"	"When the people saw the sign he had done, they said, ""This is truly the Prophet, the one who is to come into the world."""
"6:15"	"Since Jesus knew that they were going to come and carry him off to make him king, he withdrew again to the mountain alone."
"6:16"	"When it was evening, his disciples went down to the sea,"
"6:17"	"embarked in a boat, and went across the sea to Capernaum. It had already grown dark, and Jesus had not yet come to them."
"6:18"	"The sea was stirred up because a strong wind was blowing."
"6:19"	"When they had rowed about three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking on the sea and coming near the boat, and they began to be afraid."
"6:20"	"But he said to them, ""It is I. Do not be afraid."""
"6:21"	"They wanted to take him into the boat, but the boat immediately arrived at the shore to which they were heading."
"6:22"	"The next day, the crowd that remained across the sea saw that there had been only one boat there, and that Jesus had not gone along with his disciples in the boat, but only his disciples had left."
"6:23"	"Other boats came from Tiberias near the place where they had eaten the bread when the Lord gave thanks."
"6:24"	"When the crowd saw that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they themselves got into boats and came to Capernaum looking for Jesus."
"6:25"	"And when they found him across the sea they said to him, ""Rabbi, when did you get here?"""
"6:26"	"Jesus answered them and said, ""Amen, amen, I say to you, you are looking for me not because you saw signs but because you ate the loaves and were filled."
"6:27"	"Do not work for food that perishes but for the food that endures for eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you. For on him the Father, God, has set his seal."""
"6:28"	"So they said to him, ""What can we do to accomplish the works of God?"""
"6:29"	"Jesus answered and said to them, ""This is the work of God, that you believe in the one he sent."""
"6:30"	"So they said to him, ""What sign can you do, that we may see and believe in you? What can you do?"
"6:31"	"Our ancestors ate manna in the desert, as it is written: 'He gave them bread from heaven to eat.'"""
"6:32"	"So Jesus said to them, ""Amen, amen, I say to you, it was not Moses who gave the bread from heaven; my Father gives you the true bread from heaven."
"6:33"	"For the bread of God is that which comes down from heaven and gives life to the world."""
"6:34"	"So they said to him, ""Sir, give us this bread always."""
"6:35"	"Jesus said to them, ""I am the bread of life; whoever comes to me will never hunger, and whoever believes in me will never thirst."
"6:36"	"But I told you that although you have seen (me), you do not believe."
"6:37"	"Everything that the Father gives me will come to me, and I will not reject anyone who comes to me,"
"6:38"	"because I came down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of the one who sent me."
"6:39"	"And this is the will of the one who sent me, that I should not lose anything of what he gave me, but that I should raise it (on) the last day."
"6:40"	"For this is the will of my Father, that everyone who sees the Son and believes in him may have eternal life, and I shall raise him (on) the last day."""
"6:41"	"The Jews murmured about him because he said, ""I am the bread that came down from heaven,"""
"6:42"	"and they said, ""Is this not Jesus, the son of Joseph? Do we not know his father and mother? Then how can he say, 'I have come down from heaven'?"""
"6:43"	"Jesus answered and said to them, ""Stop murmuring among yourselves."
"6:44"	"No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draw him, and I will raise him on the last day."
"6:45"	"It is written in the prophets: 'They shall all be taught by God.' Everyone who listens to my Father and learns from him comes to me."
"6:46"	"Not that anyone has seen the Father except the one who is from God; he has seen the Father."
"6:47"	"Amen, amen, I say to you, whoever believes has eternal life."
"6:48"	"I am the bread of life."
"6:49"	"Your ancestors ate the manna in the desert, but they died;"
"6:50"	"this is the bread that comes down from heaven so that one may eat it and not die."
"6:51"	"I am the living bread that came down from heaven; whoever eats this bread will live forever; and the bread that I will give is my flesh for the life of the world."""
"6:52"	"The Jews quarreled among themselves, saying, ""How can this man give us (his) flesh to eat?"""
"6:53"	"Jesus said to them, ""Amen, amen, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you do not have life within you."
"6:54"	"Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him on the last day."
"6:55"	"For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink."
"6:56"	"Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me and I in him."
"6:57"	"Just as the living Father sent me and I have life because of the Father, so also the one who feeds on me will have life because of me."
"6:58"	"This is the bread that came down from heaven. Unlike your ancestors who ate and still died, whoever eats this bread will live forever."""
"6:59"	"These things he said while teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum."
"6:60"	"Then many of his disciples who were listening said, ""This saying is hard; who can accept it?"""
"6:61"	"Since Jesus knew that his disciples were murmuring about this, he said to them, ""Does this shock you?"
"6:62"	"What if you were to see the Son of Man ascending to where he was before?"
"6:63"	"It is the spirit that gives life, while the flesh is of no avail. The words I have spoken to you are spirit and life."
"6:64"	"But there are some of you who do not believe."" Jesus knew from the beginning the ones who would not believe and the one who would betray him."
"6:65"	"And he said, ""For this reason I have told you that no one can come to me unless it is granted him by my Father."""
"6:66"	"As a result of this, many (of) his disciples returned to their former way of life and no longer accompanied him."
"6:67"	"Jesus then said to the Twelve, ""Do you also want to leave?"""
"6:68"	"Simon Peter answered him, ""Master, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life."
"6:69"	"We have come to believe and are convinced that you are the Holy One of God."""
"6:70"	"Jesus answered them, ""Did I not choose you twelve? Yet is not one of you a devil?"""
"6:71"	"He was referring to Judas, son of Simon the Iscariot; it was he who would betray him, one of the Twelve."
"7:1"	"After this, Jesus moved about within Galilee; but he did not wish to travel in Judea, because the Jews were trying to kill him."
"7:2"	"But the Jewish feast of Tabernacles was near."
"7:3"	"So his brothers said to him, ""Leave here and go to Judea, so that your disciples also may see the works you are doing."
"7:4"	"No one works in secret if he wants to be known publicly. If you do these things, manifest yourself to the world."""
"7:5"	"For his brothers did not believe in him."
"7:6"	"So Jesus said to them, ""My time is not yet here, but the time is always right for you."
"7:7"	"The world cannot hate you, but it hates me, because I testify to it that its works are evil."
"7:8"	"You go up to the feast. I am not going up to this feast, because my time has not yet been fulfilled."""
"7:9"	"After he had said this, he stayed on in Galilee."
"7:10"	"But when his brothers had gone up to the feast, he himself also went up, not openly but (as it were) in secret."
"7:11"	"The Jews were looking for him at the feast and saying, ""Where is he?"""
"7:12"	"And there was considerable murmuring about him in the crowds. Some said, ""He is a good man,"" (while) others said, ""No; on the contrary, he misleads the crowd."""
"7:13"	"Still, no one spoke openly about him because they were afraid of the Jews."
"7:14"	"When the feast was already half over, Jesus went up into the temple area and began to teach."
"7:15"	"The Jews were amazed and said, ""How does he know scripture without having studied?"""
"7:16"	"Jesus answered them and said, ""My teaching is not my own but is from the one who sent me."
"7:17"	"Whoever chooses to do his will shall know whether my teaching is from God or whether I speak on my own."
"7:18"	"Whoever speaks on his own seeks his own glory, but whoever seeks the glory of the one who sent him is truthful, and there is no wrong in him."
"7:19"	"Did not Moses give you the law? Yet none of you keeps the law. Why are you trying to kill me?"""
"7:20"	"The crowd answered, ""You are possessed! Who is trying to kill you?"""
"7:21"	"Jesus answered and said to them, ""I performed one work and all of you are amazed"
"7:22"	"because of it. Moses gave you circumcision - not that it came from Moses but rather from the patriarchs - and you circumcise a man on the sabbath."
"7:23"	"If a man can receive circumcision on a sabbath so that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry with me because I made a whole person well on a sabbath?"
"7:24"	"Stop judging by appearances, but judge justly."""
"7:25"	"So some of the inhabitants of Jerusalem said, ""Is he not the one they are trying to kill?"
"7:26"	"And look, he is speaking openly and they say nothing to him. Could the authorities have realized that he is the Messiah?"
"7:27"	"But we know where he is from. When the Messiah comes, no one will know where he is from."""
"7:28"	"So Jesus cried out in the temple area as he was teaching and said, ""You know me and also know where I am from. Yet I did not come on my own, but the one who sent me, whom you do not know, is true."
"7:29"	"I know him, because I am from him, and he sent me."""
"7:30"	"So they tried to arrest him, but no one laid a hand upon him, because his hour had not yet come."
"7:31"	"But many of the crowd began to believe in him, and said, ""When the Messiah comes, will he perform more signs than this man has done?"""
"7:32"	"The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring about him to this effect, and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent guards to arrest him."
"7:33"	"So Jesus said, ""I will be with you only a little while longer, and then I will go to the one who sent me."
"7:34"	"You will look for me but not find (me), and where I am you cannot come."""
"7:35"	"So the Jews said to one another, ""Where is he going that we will not find him? Surely he is not going to the dispersion among the Greeks to teach the Greeks, is he?"
"7:36"	"What is the meaning of his saying, 'You will look for me and not find (me), and where I am you cannot come'?"""
"7:37"	"On the last and greatest day of the feast, Jesus stood up and exclaimed, ""Let anyone who thirsts come to me and drink."
"7:38"	"Whoever believes in me, as scripture says: 'Rivers of living water will flow from within him.'"""
"7:39"	"He said this in reference to the Spirit that those who came to believe in him were to receive. There was, of course, no Spirit yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified."
"7:40"	"Some in the crowd who heard these words said, ""This is truly the Prophet."""
"7:41"	"Others said, ""This is the Messiah."" But others said, ""The Messiah will not come from Galilee, will he?"
"7:42"	"Does not scripture say that the Messiah will be of David's family and come from Bethlehem, the village where David lived?"""
"7:43"	"So a division occurred in the crowd because of him."
"7:44"	"Some of them even wanted to arrest him, but no one laid hands on him."
"7:45"	"So the guards went to the chief priests and Pharisees, who asked them, ""Why did you not bring him?"""
"7:46"	"The guards answered, ""Never before has anyone spoken like this one."""
"7:47"	"So the Pharisees answered them, ""Have you also been deceived?"
"7:48"	"Have any of the authorities or the Pharisees believed in him?"
"7:49"	"But this crowd, which does not know the law, is accursed."""
"7:50"	"Nicodemus, one of their members who had come to him earlier, said to them,"
"7:51"	"""Does our law condemn a person before it first hears him and finds out what he is doing?"""
"7:52"	"They answered and said to him, ""You are not from Galilee also, are you? Look and see that no prophet arises from Galilee."""
"7:53"	"Then each went to his own house,"
"8:1"	"while Jesus went to the Mount of Olives."
"8:2"	"But early in the morning he arrived again in the temple area, and all the people started coming to him, and he sat down and taught them."
"8:3"	"Then the scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery and made her stand in the middle."
"8:4"	"They said to him, ""Teacher, this woman was caught in the very act of committing adultery."
"8:5"	"Now in the law, Moses commanded us to stone such women. So what do you say?"""
"8:6"	"They said this to test him, so that they could have some charge to bring against him. Jesus bent down and began to write on the ground with his finger."
"8:7"	"But when they continued asking him, he straightened up and said to them, ""Let the one among you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her."""
"8:8"	"Again he bent down and wrote on the ground."
"8:9"	"And in response, they went away one by one, beginning with the elders. So he was left alone with the woman before him."
"8:10"	"Then Jesus straightened up and said to her, ""Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?"""
"8:11"	"She replied, ""No one, sir."" Then Jesus said, ""Neither do I condemn you. Go, (and) from now on do not sin any more."""
"8:12"	"Jesus spoke to them again, saying, ""I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life."""
"8:13"	"So the Pharisees said to him, ""You testify on your own behalf, so your testimony cannot be verified."""
"8:14"	"Jesus answered and said to them, ""Even if I do testify on my own behalf, my testimony can be verified, because I know where I came from and where I am going. But you do not know where I come from or where I am going."
"8:15"	"You judge by appearances, but I do not judge anyone."
"8:16"	"And even if I should judge, my judgment is valid, because I am not alone, but it is I and the Father who sent me."
"8:17"	"Even in your law it is written that the testimony of two men can be verified."
"8:18"	"I testify on my behalf and so does the Father who sent me."""
"8:19"	"So they said to him, ""Where is your father?"" Jesus answered, ""You know neither me nor my Father. If you knew me, you would know my Father also."""
"8:20"	"He spoke these words while teaching in the treasury in the temple area. But no one arrested him, because his hour had not yet come."
"8:21"	"He said to them again, ""I am going away and you will look for me, but you will die in your sin. Where I am going you cannot come."""
"8:22"	"So the Jews said, ""He is not going to kill himself, is he, because he said, 'Where I am going you cannot come'?"""
"8:23"	"He said to them, ""You belong to what is below, I belong to what is above. You belong to this world, but I do not belong to this world."
"8:24"	"That is why I told you that you will die in your sins. For if you do not believe that I AM, you will die in your sins."""
"8:25"	"So they said to him, ""Who are you?"" Jesus said to them, ""What I told you from the beginning."
"8:26"	"I have much to say about you in condemnation. But the one who sent me is true, and what I heard from him I tell the world."""
"8:27"	"They did not realize that he was speaking to them of the Father."
"8:28"	"So Jesus said (to them), ""When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will realize that I AM, and that I do nothing on my own, but I say only what the Father taught me."
"8:29"	"The one who sent me is with me. He has not left me alone, because I always do what is pleasing to him."""
"8:30"	"Because he spoke this way, many came to believe in him."
"8:31"	"Jesus then said to those Jews who believed in him, ""If you remain in my word, you will truly be my disciples,"
"8:32"	"and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free."""
"8:33"	"They answered him, ""We are descendants of Abraham and have never been enslaved to anyone. How can you say, 'You will become free'?"""
"8:34"	"Jesus answered them, ""Amen, amen, I say to you, everyone who commits sin is a slave of sin."
"8:35"	"A slave does not remain in a household forever, but a son always remains."
"8:36"	"So if a son frees you, then you will truly be free."
"8:37"	"I know that you are descendants of Abraham. But you are trying to kill me, because my word has no room among you."
"8:38"	"I tell you what I have seen in the Father's presence; then do what you have heard from the Father."""
"8:39"	"They answered and said to him, ""Our father is Abraham."" Jesus said to them, ""If you were Abraham's children, you would be doing the works of Abraham."
"8:40"	"But now you are trying to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God; Abraham did not do this."
"8:41"	"You are doing the works of your father!"" (So) they said to him, ""We are not illegitimate. We have one Father, God."""
"8:42"	"Jesus said to them, ""If God were your Father, you would love me, for I came from God and am here; I did not come on my own, but he sent me."
"8:43"	"Why do you not understand what I am saying? Because you cannot bear to hear my word."
"8:44"	"You belong to your father the devil and you willingly carry out your father's desires. He was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in truth, because there is no truth in him. When he tells a lie, he speaks in character, because he is a liar and the father of lies."
"8:45"	"But because I speak the truth, you do not believe me."
"8:46"	"Can any of you charge me with sin? If I am telling the truth, why do you not believe me?"
"8:47"	"Whoever belongs to God hears the words of God; for this reason you do not listen, because you do not belong to God."""
"8:48"	"The Jews answered and said to him, ""Are we not right in saying that you are a Samaritan and are possessed?"""
"8:49"	"Jesus answered, ""I am not possessed; I honor my Father, but you dishonor me."
"8:50"	"I do not seek my own glory; there is one who seeks it and he is the one who judges."
"8:51"	"Amen, amen, I say to you, whoever keeps my word will never see death."""
"8:52"	"(So) the Jews said to him, ""Now we are sure that you are possessed. Abraham died, as did the prophets, yet you say, 'Whoever keeps my word will never taste death.'"
"8:53"	"Are you greater than our father Abraham, who died? Or the prophets, who died? Who do you make yourself out to be?"""
"8:54"	"Jesus answered, ""If I glorify myself, my glory is worth nothing; but it is my Father who glorifies me, of whom you say, 'He is our God.'"
"8:55"	"You do not know him, but I know him. And if I should say that I do not know him, I would be like you a liar. But I do know him and I keep his word."
"8:56"	"Abraham your father rejoiced to see my day; he saw it and was glad."
"8:57"	"So the Jews said to him, ""You are not yet fifty years old and you have seen Abraham?"""
"8:58"	"Jesus said to them, ""Amen, amen, I say to you, before Abraham came to be, I AM."""
"8:59"	"So they picked up stones to throw at him; but Jesus hid and went out of the temple area."
"9:1"	"As he passed by he saw a man blind from birth."
"9:2"	"His disciples asked him, ""Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?"""
"9:3"	"Jesus answered, ""Neither he nor his parents sinned; it is so that the works of God might be made visible through him."
"9:4"	"We have to do the works of the one who sent me while it is day. Night is coming when no one can work."
"9:5"	"While I am in the world, I am the light of the world."""
"9:6"	"When he had said this, he spat on the ground and made clay with the saliva, and smeared the clay on his eyes,"
"9:7"	"and said to him, ""Go wash in the Pool of Siloam"" (which means Sent). So he went and washed, and came back able to see."
"9:8"	"His neighbors and those who had seen him earlier as a beggar said, ""Isn't this the one who used to sit and beg?"""
"9:9"	"Some said, ""It is,"" but others said, ""No, he just looks like him."" He said, ""I am."""
"9:10"	"So they said to him, ""(So) how were your eyes opened?"""
"9:11"	"He replied, ""The man called Jesus made clay and anointed my eyes and told me, 'Go to Siloam and wash.' So I went there and washed and was able to see."""
"9:12"	"And they said to him, ""Where is he?"" He said, ""I don't know."""
"9:13"	"They brought the one who was once blind to the Pharisees."
"9:14"	"Now Jesus had made clay and opened his eyes on a sabbath."
"9:15"	"So then the Pharisees also asked him how he was able to see. He said to them, ""He put clay on my eyes, and I washed, and now I can see."""
"9:16"	"So some of the Pharisees said, ""This man is not from God, because he does not keep the sabbath."" (But) others said, ""How can a sinful man do such signs?"" And there was a division among them."
"9:17"	"So they said to the blind man again, ""What do you have to say about him, since he opened your eyes?"" He said, ""He is a prophet."""
"9:18"	"Now the Jews did not believe that he had been blind and gained his sight until they summoned the parents of the one who had gained his sight."
"9:19"	"They asked them, ""Is this your son, who you say was born blind? How does he now see?"""
"9:20"	"His parents answered and said, ""We know that this is our son and that he was born blind."
"9:21"	"We do not know how he sees now, nor do we know who opened his eyes. Ask him, he is of age; he can speak for him self."""
"9:22"	"His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jews, for the Jews had already agreed that if anyone acknowledged him as the Messiah, he would be expelled from the synagogue."
"9:23"	"For this reason his parents said, ""He is of age; question him."""
"9:24"	"So a second time they called the man who had been blind and said to him, ""Give God the praise! We know that this man is a sinner."""
"9:25"	"He replied, ""If he is a sinner, I do not know. One thing I do know is that I was blind and now I see."""
"9:26"	"So they said to him, ""What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?"""
"9:27"	"He answered them, ""I told you already and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you want to become his disciples, too?"""
"9:28"	"They ridiculed him and said, ""You are that man's disciple; we are disciples of Moses!"
"9:29"	"We know that God spoke to Moses, but we do not know where this one is from."""
"9:30"	"The man answered and said to them, ""This is what is so amazing, that you do not know where he is from, yet he opened my eyes."
"9:31"	"We know that God does not listen to sinners, but if one is devout and does his will, he listens to him."
"9:32"	"It is unheard of that anyone ever opened the eyes of a person born blind."
"9:33"	"If this man were not from God, he would not be able to do anything."""
"9:34"	"They answered and said to him, ""You were born totally in sin, and are you trying to teach us?"" Then they threw him out."
"9:35"	"When Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, he found him and said, ""Do you believe in the Son of Man?"""
"9:36"	"He answered and said, ""Who is he, sir, that I may believe in him?"""
"9:37"	"Jesus said to him, ""You have seen him and the one speaking with you is he."""
"9:38"	"He said, ""I do believe, Lord,"" and he worshiped him."
"9:39"	"Then Jesus said, ""I came into this world for judgment, so that those who do not see might see, and those who do see might become blind."""
"9:40"	"Some of the Pharisees who were with him heard this and said to him, ""Surely we are not also blind, are we?"""
"9:41"	"Jesus said to them, ""If you were blind, you would have no sin; but now you are saying, 'We see,' so your sin remains."
"10:1"	"""Amen, amen, I say to you, whoever does not enter a sheepfold through the gate but climbs over elsewhere is a thief and a robber."
"10:2"	"But whoever enters through the gate is the shepherd of the sheep."
"10:3"	"The gatekeeper opens it for him, and the sheep hear his voice, as he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out."
"10:4"	"When he has driven out all his own, he walks ahead of them, and the sheep follow him, because they recognize his voice."
"10:5"	"But they will not follow a stranger; they will run away from him, because they do not recognize the voice of strangers."""
"10:6"	"Although Jesus used this figure of speech, they did not realize what he was trying to tell them."
"10:7"	"So Jesus said again, ""Amen, amen, I say to you, I am the gate for the sheep."
"10:8"	"All who came [before me] are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them."
"10:9"	"I am the gate. Whoever enters through me will be saved, and will come in and go out and find pasture."
"10:10"	"A thief comes only to steal and slaughter and destroy; I came so that they might have life and have it more abundantly."
"10:11"	"I am the good shepherd. A good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep."
"10:12"	"A hired man, who is not a shepherd and whose sheep are not his own, sees a wolf coming and leaves the sheep and runs away, and the wolf catches and scatters them."
"10:13"	"This is because he works for pay and has no concern for the sheep."
"10:14"	"I am the good shepherd, and I know mine and mine know me,"
"10:15"	"just as the Father knows me and I know the Father; and I will lay down my life for the sheep."
"10:16"	"I have other sheep that do not belong to this fold. These also I must lead, and they will hear my voice, and there will be one flock, one shepherd."
"10:17"	"This is why the Father loves me, because I lay down my life in order to take it up again."
"10:18"	"No one takes it from me, but I lay it down on my own. I have power to lay it down, and power to take it up again. This command I have received from my Father."""
"10:19"	"Again there was a division among the Jews because of these words."
"10:20"	"Many of them said, ""He is possessed and out of his mind; why listen to him?"""
"10:21"	"Others said, ""These are not the words of one possessed; surely a demon cannot open the eyes of the blind, can he?"""
"10:22"	"The feast of the Dedication was then taking place in Jerusalem. It was winter."
"10:23"	"And Jesus walked about in the temple area on the Portico of Solomon."
"10:24"	"So the Jews gathered around him and said to him, ""How long are you going to keep us in suspense? If you are the Messiah, tell us plainly."""
"10:25"	"Jesus answered them, ""I told you and you do not believe. The works I do in my Father's name testify to me."
"10:26"	"But you do not believe, because you are not among my sheep."
"10:27"	"My sheep hear my voice; I know them, and they follow me."
"10:28"	"I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish. No one can take them out of my hand."
"10:29"	"My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, and no one can take them out of the Father's hand."
"10:30"	"The Father and I are one."""
"10:31"	"The Jews again picked up rocks to stone him."
"10:32"	"Jesus answered them, ""I have shown you many good works from my Father. For which of these are you trying to stone me?"""
"10:33"	"The Jews answered him, ""We are not stoning you for a good work but for blasphemy. You, a man, are making yourself God."""
"10:34"	"Jesus answered them, ""Is it not written in your law, 'I said, ""You are gods""'?"
"10:35"	"If it calls them gods to whom the word of God came, and scripture cannot be set aside,"
"10:36"	"can you say that the one whom the Father has consecrated and sent into the world blasphemes because I said, 'I am the Son of God'?"
"10:37"	"If I do not perform my Father's works, do not believe me;"
"10:38"	"but if I perform them, even if you do not believe me, believe the works, so that you may realize (and understand) that the Father is in me and I am in the Father."""
"10:39"	"(Then) they tried again to arrest him; but he escaped from their power."
"10:40"	"He went back across the Jordan to the place where John first baptized, and there he remained."
"10:41"	"Many came to him and said, ""John performed no sign, but everything John said about this man was true."""
"10:42"	"And many there began to believe in him."
"11:1"	"Now a man was ill, Lazarus from Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha."
"11:2"	"Mary was the one who had anointed the Lord with perfumed oil and dried his feet with her hair; it was her brother Lazarus who was ill."
"11:3"	"So the sisters sent word to him, saying, ""Master, the one you love is ill."""
"11:4"	"When Jesus heard this he said, ""This illness is not to end in death, but is for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified through it."""
"11:5"	"Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus."
"11:6"	"So when he heard that he was ill, he remained for two days in the place where he was."
"11:7"	"Then after this he said to his disciples, ""Let us go back to Judea."""
"11:8"	"The disciples said to him, ""Rabbi, the Jews were just trying to stone you, and you want to go back there?"""
"11:9"	"Jesus answered, ""Are there not twelve hours in a day? If one walks during the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world."
"11:10"	"But if one walks at night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him."""
"11:11"	"He said this, and then told them, ""Our friend Lazarus is asleep, but I am going to awaken him."""
"11:12"	"So the disciples said to him, ""Master, if he is asleep, he will be saved."""
"11:13"	"But Jesus was talking about his death, while they thought that he meant ordinary sleep."
"11:14"	"So then Jesus said to them clearly, ""Lazarus has died."
"11:15"	"And I am glad for you that I was not there, that you may believe. Let us go to him."""
"11:16"	"So Thomas, called Didymus, said to his fellow disciples, ""Let us also go to die with him."""
"11:17"	"When Jesus arrived, he found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb for four days."
"11:18"	"Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, only about two miles away."
"11:19"	"And many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to comfort them about their brother."
"11:20"	"When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went to meet him; but Mary sat at home."
"11:21"	"Martha said to Jesus, ""Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died."
"11:22"	"(But) even now I know that whatever you ask of God, God will give you."""
"11:23"	"Jesus said to her, ""Your brother will rise."""
"11:24"	"Martha said to him, ""I know he will rise, in the resurrection on the last day."""
"11:25"	"Jesus told her, ""I am the resurrection and the life; whoever believes in me, even if he dies, will live,"
"11:26"	"and everyone who lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?"""
"11:27"	"She said to him, ""Yes, Lord. I have come to believe that you are the Messiah, the Son of God, the one who is coming into the world."""
"11:28"	"When she had said this, she went and called her sister Mary secretly, saying, ""The teacher is here and is asking for you."""
"11:29"	"As soon as she heard this, she rose quickly and went to him."
"11:30"	"For Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was still where Martha had met him."
"11:31"	"So when the Jews who were with her in the house comforting her saw Mary get up quickly and go out, they followed her, presuming that she was going to the tomb to weep there."
"11:32"	"When Mary came to where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his feet and said to him, ""Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died."""
"11:33"	"When Jesus saw her weeping and the Jews who had come with her weeping, he became perturbed and deeply troubled,"
"11:34"	"and said, ""Where have you laid him?"" They said to him, ""Sir, come and see."""
"11:35"	"And Jesus wept."
"11:36"	"So the Jews said, ""See how he loved him."""
"11:37"	"But some of them said, ""Could not the one who opened the eyes of the blind man have done something so that this man would not have died?"""
"11:38"	"So Jesus, perturbed again, came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone lay across it."
"11:39"	"Jesus said, ""Take away the stone."" Martha, the dead man's sister, said to him, ""Lord, by now there will be a stench; he has been dead for four days."""
"11:40"	"Jesus said to her, ""Did I not tell you that if you believe you will see the glory of God?"""
"11:41"	"So they took away the stone. And Jesus raised his eyes and said, ""Father, I thank you for hearing me."
"11:42"	"I know that you always hear me; but because of the crowd here I have said this, that they may believe that you sent me."""
"11:43"	"And when he had said this, he cried out in a loud voice, ""Lazarus, come out!"""
"11:44"	"The dead man came out, tied hand and foot with burial bands, and his face was wrapped in a cloth. So Jesus said to them, ""Untie him and let him go."""
"11:45"	"Now many of the Jews who had come to Mary and seen what he had done began to believe in him."
"11:46"	"But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done."
"11:47"	"So the chief priests and the Pharisees convened the Sanhedrin and said, ""What are we going to do? This man is performing many signs."
"11:48"	"If we leave him alone, all will believe in him, and the Romans will come and take away both our land and our nation."""
"11:49"	"But one of them, Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them, ""You know nothing,"
"11:50"	"nor do you consider that it is better for you that one man should die instead of the people, so that the whole nation may not perish."""
"11:51"	"He did not say this on his own, but since he was high priest for that year, he prophesied that Jesus was going to die for the nation,"
"11:52"	"and not only for the nation, but also to gather into one the dispersed children of God."
"11:53"	"So from that day on they planned to kill him."
"11:54"	"So Jesus no longer walked about in public among the Jews, but he left for the region near the desert, to a town called Ephraim, and there he remained with his disciples."
"11:55"	"Now the Passover of the Jews was near, and many went up from the country to Jerusalem before Passover to purify themselves."
"11:56"	"They looked for Jesus and said to one another as they were in the temple area, ""What do you think? That he will not come to the feast?"""
"11:57"	"For the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if anyone knew where he was, he should inform them, so that they might arrest him."
"12:1"	"Six days before Passover Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom Jesus had raised from the dead."
"12:2"	"They gave a dinner for him there, and Martha served, while Lazarus was one of those reclining at table with him."
"12:3"	"Mary took a liter of costly perfumed oil made from genuine aromatic nard and anointed the feet of Jesus and dried them with her hair; the house was filled with the fragrance of the oil."
"12:4"	"Then Judas the Iscariot, one (of) his disciples, and the one who would betray him, said,"
"12:5"	"""Why was this oil not sold for three hundred days' wages and given to the poor?"""
"12:6"	"He said this not because he cared about the poor but because he was a thief and held the money bag and used to steal the contributions."
"12:7"	"So Jesus said, ""Leave her alone. Let her keep this for the day of my burial."
"12:8"	"You always have the poor with you, but you do not always have me."""
"12:9"	"(The) large crowd of the Jews found out that he was there and came, not only because of Jesus, but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead."
"12:10"	"And the chief priests plotted to kill Lazarus too,"
"12:11"	"because many of the Jews were turning away and believing in Jesus because of him."
"12:12"	"On the next day, when the great crowd that had come to the feast heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,"
"12:13"	"they took palm branches and went out to meet him, and cried out: ""Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, (even) the king of Israel."""
"12:14"	"Jesus found an ass and sat upon it, as is written:"
"12:15"	"""Fear no more, O daughter Zion; see, your king comes, seated upon an ass's colt."""
"12:16"	"His disciples did not understand this at first, but when Jesus had been glorified they remembered that these things were written about him and that they had done this for him."
"12:17"	"So the crowd that was with him when he called Lazarus from the tomb and raised him from death continued to testify."
"12:18"	"This was (also) why the crowd went to meet him, because they heard that he had done this sign."
"12:19"	"So the Pharisees said to one another, ""You see that you are gaining nothing. Look, the whole world has gone after him."""
"12:20"	"Now there were some Greeks among those who had come up to worship at the feast."
"12:21"	"They came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and asked him, ""Sir, we would like to see Jesus."""
"12:22"	"Philip went and told Andrew; then Andrew and Philip went and told Jesus."
"12:23"	"Jesus answered them, ""The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified."
"12:24"	"Amen, amen, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains just a grain of wheat; but if it dies, it produces much fruit."
"12:25"	"Whoever loves his life loses it, and whoever hates his life in this world will preserve it for eternal life."
"12:26"	"Whoever serves me must follow me, and where I am, there also will my servant be. The Father will honor whoever serves me."
"12:27"	"""I am troubled now. Yet what should I say? 'Father, save me from this hour'? But it was for this purpose that I came to this hour."
"12:28"	"Father, glorify your name."" Then a voice came from heaven, ""I have glorified it and will glorify it again."""
"12:29"	"The crowd there heard it and said it was thunder; but others said, ""An angel has spoken to him."""
"12:30"	"Jesus answered and said, ""This voice did not come for my sake but for yours."
"12:31"	"Now is the time of judgment on this world; now the ruler of this world will be driven out."
"12:32"	"And when I am lifted up from the earth, I will draw everyone to myself."""
"12:33"	"He said this indicating the kind of death he would die."
"12:34"	"So the crowd answered him, ""We have heard from the law that the Messiah remains forever. Then how can you say that the Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?"""
"12:35"	"Jesus said to them, ""The light will be among you only a little while. Walk while you have the light, so that darkness may not overcome you. Whoever walks in the dark does not know where he is going."
"12:36"	"While you have the light, believe in the light, so that you may become children of the light."" After he had said this, Jesus left and hid from them."
"12:37"	"Although he had performed so many signs in their presence they did not believe in him,"
"12:38"	"in order that the word which Isaiah the prophet spoke might be fulfilled: ""Lord, who has believed our preaching, to whom has the might of the Lord been revealed?"""
"12:39"	"For this reason they could not believe, because again Isaiah said:"
"12:40"	"""He blinded their eyes and hardened their heart, so that they might not see with their eyes and understand with their heart and be converted, and I would heal them."""
"12:41"	"Isaiah said this because he saw his glory and spoke about him."
"12:42"	"Nevertheless, many, even among the authorities, believed in him, but because of the Pharisees they did not acknowledge it openly in order not to be expelled from the synagogue."
"12:43"	"For they preferred human praise to the glory of God."
"12:44"	"Jesus cried out and said, ""Whoever believes in me believes not only in me but also in the one who sent me,"
"12:45"	"and whoever sees me sees the one who sent me."
"12:46"	"I came into the world as light, so that everyone who believes in me might not remain in darkness."
"12:47"	"And if anyone hears my words and does not observe them, I do not condemn him, for I did not come to condemn the world but to save the world."
"12:48"	"Whoever rejects me and does not accept my words has something to judge him: the word that I spoke, it will condemn him on the last day,"
"12:49"	"because I did not speak on my own, but the Father who sent me commanded me what to say and speak."
"12:50"	"And I know that his commandment is eternal life. So what I say, I say as the Father told me."""
"13:1"	"Before the feast of Passover, Jesus knew that his hour had come to pass from this world to the Father. He loved his own in the world and he loved them to the end."
"13:2"	"The devil had already induced Judas, son of Simon the Iscariot, to hand him over. So, during supper,"
"13:3"	"fully aware that the Father had put everything into his power and that he had come from God and was returning to God,"
"13:4"	"he rose from supper and took off his outer garments. He took a towel and tied it around his waist."
"13:5"	"Then he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples' feet and dry them with the towel around his waist."
"13:6"	"He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, ""Master, are you going to wash my feet?"""
"13:7"	"Jesus answered and said to him, ""What I am doing, you do not understand now, but you will understand later."""
"13:8"	"Peter said to him, ""You will never wash my feet."" Jesus answered him, ""Unless I wash you, you will have no inheritance with me."""
"13:9"	"Simon Peter said to him, ""Master, then not only my feet, but my hands and head as well."""
"13:10"	"Jesus said to him, ""Whoever has bathed has no need except to have his feet washed, for he is clean all over; so you are clean, but not all."""
"13:11"	"For he knew who would betray him; for this reason, he said, ""Not all of you are clean."""
"13:12"	"So when he had washed their feet (and) put his garments back on and reclined at table again, he said to them, ""Do you realize what I have done for you?"
"13:13"	"You call me 'teacher' and 'master,' and rightly so, for indeed I am."
"13:14"	"If I, therefore, the master and teacher, have washed your feet, you ought to wash one another's feet."
"13:15"	"I have given you a model to follow, so that as I have done for you, you should also do."
"13:16"	"Amen, amen, I say to you, no slave is greater than his master nor any messenger greater than the one who sent him."
"13:17"	"If you understand this, blessed are you if you do it."
"13:18"	"I am not speaking of all of you. I know those whom I have chosen. But so that the scripture might be fulfilled, 'The one who ate my food has raised his heel against me.'"
"13:19"	"From now on I am telling you before it happens, so that when it happens you may believe that I AM."
"13:20"	"Amen, amen, I say to you, whoever receives the one I send receives me, and whoever receives me receives the one who sent me."""
"13:21"	"When he had said this, Jesus was deeply troubled and testified, ""Amen, amen, I say to you, one of you will betray me."""
"13:22"	"The disciples looked at one another, at a loss as to whom he meant."
"13:23"	"One of his disciples, the one whom Jesus loved, was reclining at Jesus' side."
"13:24"	"So Simon Peter nodded to him to find out whom he meant."
"13:25"	"He leaned back against Jesus' chest and said to him, ""Master, who is it?"""
"13:26"	"Jesus answered, ""It is the one to whom I hand the morsel after I have dipped it."" So he dipped the morsel and (took it and) handed it to Judas, son of Simon the Iscariot."
"13:27"	"After he took the morsel, Satan entered him. So Jesus said to him, ""What you are going to do, do quickly."""
"13:28"	"(Now) none of those reclining at table realized why he said this to him."
"13:29"	"Some thought that since Judas kept the money bag, Jesus had told him, ""Buy what we need for the feast,"" or to give something to the poor."
"13:30"	"So he took the morsel and left at once. And it was night."
"13:31"	"When he had left, Jesus said, ""Now is the Son of Man glorified, and God is glorified in him."
"13:32"	"(If God is glorified in him,) God will also glorify him in himself, and he will glorify him at once."
"13:33"	"My children, I will be with you only a little while longer. You will look for me, and as I told the Jews, 'Where I go you cannot come,' so now I say it to you."
"13:34"	"I give you a new commandment: love one another. As I have loved you, so you also should love one another."
"13:35"	"This is how all will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another."""
"13:36"	"Simon Peter said to him, ""Master, where are you going?"" Jesus answered (him), ""Where I am going, you cannot follow me now, though you will follow later."""
"13:37"	"Peter said to him, ""Master, why can't I follow you now? I will lay down my life for you."""
"13:38"	"Jesus answered, ""Will you lay down your life for me? Amen, amen, I say to you, the cock will not crow before you deny me three times."""
"14:1"	"""Do not let your hearts be troubled. You have faith in God; have faith also in me."
"14:2"	"In my Father's house there are many dwelling places. If there were not, would I have told you that I am going to prepare a place for you?"
"14:3"	"And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back again and take you to myself, so that where I am you also may be."
"14:4"	"Where (I) am going you know the way."""
"14:5"	"Thomas said to him, ""Master, we do not know where you are going; how can we know the way?"""
"14:6"	"Jesus said to him, ""I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me."
"14:7"	"If you know me, then you will also know my Father. From now on you do know him and have seen him."""
"14:8"	"Philip said to him, ""Master, show us the Father, and that will be enough for us."""
"14:9"	"Jesus said to him, ""Have I been with you for so long a time and you still do not know me, Philip? Whoever has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, 'Show us the Father'?"
"14:10"	"Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words that I speak to you I do not speak on my own. The Father who dwells in me is doing his works."
"14:11"	"Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father is in me, or else, believe because of the works themselves."
"14:12"	"Amen, amen, I say to you, whoever believes in me will do the works that I do, and will do greater ones than these, because I am going to the Father."
"14:13"	"And whatever you ask in my name, I will do, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son."
"14:14"	"If you ask anything of me in my name, I will do it."
"14:15"	"""If you love me, you will keep my commandments."
"14:16"	"And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Advocate to be with you always,"
"14:17"	"the Spirit of truth, which the world cannot accept, because it neither sees nor knows it. But you know it, because it remains with you, and will be in you."
"14:18"	"I will not leave you orphans; I will come to you."
"14:19"	"In a little while the world will no longer see me, but you will see me, because I live and you will live."
"14:20"	"On that day you will realize that I am in my Father and you are in me and I in you."
"14:21"	"Whoever has my commandments and observes them is the one who loves me. And whoever loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him and reveal myself to him."""
"14:22"	"Judas, not the Iscariot, said to him, ""Master, (then) what happened that you will reveal yourself to us and not to the world?"""
"14:23"	"Jesus answered and said to him, ""Whoever loves me will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our dwelling with him."
"14:24"	"Whoever does not love me does not keep my words; yet the word you hear is not mine but that of the Father who sent me."
"14:25"	"""I have told you this while I am with you."
"14:26"	"The Advocate, the holy Spirit that the Father will send in my name - he will teach you everything and remind you of all that (I) told you."
"14:27"	"Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you. Not as the world gives do I give it to you. Do not let your hearts be troubled or afraid."
"14:28"	"You heard me tell you, 'I am going away and I will come back to you.' If you loved me, you would rejoice that I am going to the Father; for the Father is greater than I."
"14:29"	"And now I have told you this before it happens, so that when it happens you may believe."
"14:30"	"I will no longer speak much with you, for the ruler of the world is coming. He has no power over me,"
"14:31"	"but the world must know that I love the Father and that I do just as the Father has commanded me. Get up, let us go."
"15:1"	"""I am the true vine, and my Father is the vine grower."
"15:2"	"He takes away every branch in me that does not bear fruit, and everyone that does he prunes so that it bears more fruit."
"15:3"	"You are already pruned because of the word that I spoke to you."
"15:4"	"Remain in me, as I remain in you. Just as a branch cannot bear fruit on its own unless it remains on the vine, so neither can you unless you remain in me."
"15:5"	"I am the vine, you are the branches. Whoever remains in me and I in him will bear much fruit, because without me you can do nothing."
"15:6"	"Anyone who does not remain in me will be thrown out like a branch and wither; people will gather them and throw them into a fire and they will be burned."
"15:7"	"If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask for whatever you want and it will be done for you."
"15:8"	"By this is my Father glorified, that you bear much fruit and become my disciples."
"15:9"	"As the Father loves me, so I also love you. Remain in my love."
"15:10"	"If you keep my commandments, you will remain in my love, just as I have kept my Father's commandments and remain in his love."
"15:11"	"""I have told you this so that my joy may be in you and your joy may be complete."

"15:14"	"You are my friends if you do what I command you."
"15:15"	"I no longer call you slaves, because a slave does not know what his master is doing. I have called you friends, because I have told you everything I have heard from my Father."
"15:16"	"It was not you who chose me, but I who chose you and appointed you to go and bear fruit that will remain, so that whatever you ask the Father in my name he may give you."

"15:20"	"Remember the word I spoke to you, 'No slave is greater than his master.' If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you. If they kept my word, they will also keep yours."

"16:21"	"When a woman is in labor, she is in anguish because her hour has arrived; but when she has given birth to a child, she no longer remembers the pain because of her joy that a child has been born into the world."
"16:22"	"So you also are now in anguish. But I will see you again, and your hearts will rejoice, and no one will take your joy away from you."
"16:23"	"On that day you will not question me about anything. Amen, amen, I say to you, whatever you ask the Father in my name he will give you."
"16:24"	"Until now you have not asked anything in my name; ask and you will receive, so that your joy may be complete."
"16:25"	"""I have told you this in figures of speech. The hour is coming when I will no longer speak to you in figures but I will tell you clearly about the Father."
"16:26"	"On that day you will ask in my name, and I do not tell you that I will ask the Father for you."
"16:27"	"For the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me and have come to believe that I came from God."
"16:28"	"I came from the Father and have come into the world. Now I am leaving the world and going back to the Father."""
"16:29"	"His disciples said, ""Now you are talking plainly, and not in any figure of speech."
"16:30"	"Now we realize that you know everything and that you do not need to have anyone question you. Because of this we believe that you came from God."""
"16:31"	"Jesus answered them, ""Do you believe now?"
"16:32"	"Behold, the hour is coming and has arrived when each of you will be scattered to his own home and you will leave me alone. But I am not alone, because the Father is with me."
"16:33"	"I have told you this so that you might have peace in me. In the world you will have trouble, but take courage, I have conquered the world."""
"17:1"	"When Jesus had said this, he raised his eyes to heaven and said, ""Father, the hour has come. Give glory to your son, so that your son may glorify you,"
"17:2"	"just as you gave him authority over all people, so that he may give eternal life to all you gave him."
"17:3"	"Now this is eternal life, that they should know you, the only true God, and the one whom you sent, Jesus Christ."
"17:4"	"I glorified you on earth by accomplishing the work that you gave me to do."
"17:5"	"Now glorify me, Father, with you, with the glory that I had with you before the world began."
"17:6"	"""I revealed your name to those whom you gave me out of the world. They belonged to you, and you gave them to me, and they have kept your word."
"17:7"	"Now they know that everything you gave me is from you,"
"17:8"	"because the words you gave to me I have given to them, and they accepted them and truly understood that I came from you, and they have believed that you sent me."
"17:9"	"I pray for them. I do not pray for the world but for the ones you have given me, because they are yours,"
"17:10"	"and everything of mine is yours and everything of yours is mine, and I have been glorified in them."
"17:11"	"And now I will no longer be in the world, but they are in the world, while I am coming to you. Holy Father, keep them in your name that you have given me, so that they may be one just as we are."
"17:12"	"When I was with them I protected them in your name that you gave me, and I guarded them, and none of them was lost except the son of destruction, in order that the scripture might be fulfilled."
"17:13"	"But now I am coming to you. I speak this in the world so that they may share my joy completely."
"17:14"	"I gave them your word, and the world hated them, because they do not belong to the world any more than I belong to the world."
"17:15"	"I do not ask that you take them out of the world but that you keep them from the evil one."
"17:16"	"They do not belong to the world any more than I belong to the world."
"17:17"	"Consecrate them in the truth. Your word is truth."
"17:18"	"As you sent me into the world, so I sent them into the world."
"17:19"	"And I consecrate myself for them, so that they also may be consecrated in truth."
"17:20"	"""I pray not only for them, but also for those who will believe in me through their word,"
"17:21"	"so that they may all be one, as you, Father, are in me and I in you, that they also may be in us, that the world may believe that you sent me."
"17:22"	"And I have given them the glory you gave me, so that they may be one, as we are one,"
"17:23"	"I in them and you in me, that they may be brought to perfection as one, that the world may know that you sent me, and that you loved them even as you loved me."
"17:24"	"Father, they are your gift to me. I wish that where I am they also may be with me, that they may see my glory that you gave me, because you loved me before the foundation of the world."
"17:25"	"Righteous Father, the world also does not know you, but I know you, and they know that you sent me."
"17:26"	"I made known to them your name and I will make it known, that the love with which you loved me may be in them and I in them."""
"18:1"	"When he had said this, Jesus went out with his disciples across the Kidron valley to where there was a garden, into which he and his disciples entered."
"18:2"	"Judas his betrayer also knew the place, because Jesus had often met there with his disciples."
"18:3"	"So Judas got a band of soldiers and guards from the chief priests and the Pharisees and went there with lanterns, torches, and weapons."
"18:4"	"Jesus, knowing everything that was going to happen to him, went out and said to them, ""Whom are you looking for?"""
"18:5"	"They answered him, ""Jesus the Nazorean."" He said to them, ""I AM."" Judas his betrayer was also with them."
"18:6"	"When he said to them, ""I AM,"" they turned away and fell to the ground."
"18:7"	"So he again asked them, ""Whom are you looking for?"" They said, ""Jesus the Nazorean."""
"18:8"	"Jesus answered, ""I told you that I AM. So if you are looking for me, let these men go."""
"18:9"	"This was to fulfill what he had said, ""I have not lost any of those you gave me."""
"18:10"	"Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it, struck the high priest's slave, and cut off his right ear. The slave's name was Malchus."
"18:11"	"Jesus said to Peter, ""Put your sword into its scabbard. Shall I not drink the cup that the Father gave me?"""
"18:12"	"So the band of soldiers, the tribune, and the Jewish guards seized Jesus, bound him,"
"18:13"	"and brought him to Annas first. He was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest that year."
"18:14"	"It was Caiaphas who had counseled the Jews that it was better that one man should die rather than the people."
"18:15"	"Simon Peter and another disciple followed Jesus. Now the other disciple was known to the high priest, and he entered the courtyard of the high priest with Jesus."
"18:16"	"But Peter stood at the gate outside. So the other disciple, the acquaintance of the high priest, went out and spoke to the gatekeeper and brought Peter in."
"18:17"	"Then the maid who was the gatekeeper said to Peter, ""You are not one of this man's disciples, are you?"" He said, ""I am not."""
"18:18"	"Now the slaves and the guards were standing around a charcoal fire that they had made, because it was cold, and were warming themselves. Peter was also standing there keeping warm."
"18:19"	"The high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and about his doctrine."
"18:20"	"Jesus answered him, ""I have spoken publicly to the world. I have always taught in a synagogue or in the temple area where all the Jews gather, and in secret I have said nothing."
"18:21"	"Why ask me? Ask those who heard me what I said to them. They know what I said."""
"18:22"	"When he had said this, one of the temple guards standing there struck Jesus and said, ""Is this the way you answer the high priest?"""
"18:23"	"Jesus answered him, ""If I have spoken wrongly, testify to the wrong; but if I have spoken rightly, why do you strike me?"""
"18:24"	"Then Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest."
"18:25"	"Now Simon Peter was standing there keeping warm. And they said to him, ""You are not one of his disciples, are you?"" He denied it and said, ""I am not."""
"18:26"	"One of the slaves of the high priest, a relative of the one whose ear Peter had cut off, said, ""Didn't I see you in the garden with him?"""
"18:27"	"Again Peter denied it. And immediately the cock crowed."
"18:28"	"Then they brought Jesus from Caiaphas to the praetorium. It was morning. And they themselves did not enter the praetorium, in order not to be defiled so that they could eat the Passover."
"18:29"	"So Pilate came out to them and said, ""What charge do you bring (against) this man?"""
"18:30"	"They answered and said to him, ""If he were not a criminal, we would not have handed him over to you."""
"18:31"	"At this, Pilate said to them, ""Take him yourselves, and judge him according to your law."" The Jews answered him, ""We do not have the right to execute anyone,"""
"18:32"	"in order that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled that he said indicating the kind of death he would die."
"18:33"	"So Pilate went back into the praetorium and summoned Jesus and said to him, ""Are you the King of the Jews?"""
"18:34"	"Jesus answered, ""Do you say this on your own or have others told you about me?"""
"18:35"	"Pilate answered, ""I am not a Jew, am I? Your own nation and the chief priests handed you over to me. What have you done?"""
"18:36"	"Jesus answered, ""My kingdom does not belong to this world. If my kingdom did belong to this world, my attendants (would) be fighting to keep me from being handed over to the Jews. But as it is, my kingdom is not here."""
"18:37"	"So Pilate said to him, ""Then you are a king?"" Jesus answered, ""You say I am a king. For this I was born and for this I came into the world, to testify to the truth. Everyone who belongs to the truth listens to my voice."""
"18:38"	"Pilate said to him, ""What is truth?"" When he had said this, he again went out to the Jews and said to them, ""I find no guilt in him."
"18:39"	"But you have a custom that I release one prisoner to you at Passover. Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?"""
"18:40"	"They cried out again, ""Not this one but Barabbas!"" Now Barabbas was a revolutionary."
"19:1"	"Then Pilate took Jesus and had him scourged."
"19:2"	"And the soldiers wove a crown out of thorns and placed it on his head, and clothed him in a purple cloak,"
"19:3"	"and they came to him and said, ""Hail, King of the Jews!"" And they struck him repeatedly."
"19:4"	"Once more Pilate went out and said to them, ""Look, I am bringing him out to you, so that you may know that I find no guilt in him."""
"19:5"	"So Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple cloak. And he said to them, ""Behold, the man!"""
"19:6"	"When the chief priests and the guards saw him they cried out, ""Crucify him, crucify him!"" Pilate said to them, ""Take him yourselves and crucify him. I find no guilt in him."""
"19:7"	"The Jews answered, ""We have a law, and according to that law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God."""
"19:8"	"Now when Pilate heard this statement, he became even more afraid,"
"19:9"	"and went back into the praetorium and said to Jesus, ""Where are you from?"" Jesus did not answer him."
"19:10"	"So Pilate said to him, ""Do you not speak to me? Do you not know that I have power to release you and I have power to crucify you?"""
"19:11"	"Jesus answered (him), ""You would have no power over me if it had not been given to you from above. For this reason the one who handed me over to you has the greater sin."""
"19:12"	"Consequently, Pilate tried to release him; but the Jews cried out, ""If you release him, you are not a Friend of Caesar. Everyone who makes himself a king opposes Caesar."""
"19:13"	"When Pilate heard these words he brought Jesus out and seated him on the judge's bench in the place called Stone Pavement, in Hebrew, Gabbatha."
"19:14"	"It was preparation day for Passover, and it was about noon. And he said to the Jews, ""Behold, your king!"""
"19:15"	"They cried out, ""Take him away, take him away! Crucify him!"" Pilate said to them, ""Shall I crucify your king?"" The chief priests answered, ""We have no king but Caesar."""
"19:16"	"Then he handed him over to them to be crucified. So they took Jesus,"
"19:17"	"and carrying the cross himself he went out to what is called the Place of the Skull, in Hebrew, Golgotha."
"19:18"	"There they crucified him, and with him two others, one on either side, with Jesus in the middle."
"19:19"	"Pilate also had an inscription written and put on the cross. It read, ""Jesus the Nazorean, the King of the Jews."""
"19:20"	"Now many of the Jews read this inscription, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek."
"19:21"	"So the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, ""Do not write 'The King of the Jews,' but that he said, 'I am the King of the Jews.'"""
"19:22"	"Pilate answered, ""What I have written, I have written."""
"19:23"	"When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his clothes and divided them into four shares, a share for each soldier. They also took his tunic, but the tunic was seamless, woven in one piece from the top down."
"19:24"	"So they said to one another, ""Let's not tear it, but cast lots for it to see whose it will be,"" in order that the passage of scripture might be fulfilled (that says): ""They divided my garments among them, and for my vesture they cast lots."" This is what the soldiers did."
"19:25"	"Standing by the cross of Jesus were his mother and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary of Magdala."
"19:26"	"When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple there whom he loved, he said to his mother, ""Woman, behold, your son."""
"19:27"	"Then he said to the disciple, ""Behold, your mother."" And from that hour the disciple took her into his home."
"19:28"	"After this, aware that everything was now finished, in order that the scripture might be fulfilled, Jesus said, ""I thirst."""
"19:29"	"There was a vessel filled with common wine. So they put a sponge soaked in wine on a sprig of hyssop and put it up to his mouth."
"19:30"	"When Jesus had taken the wine, he said, ""It is finished."" And bowing his head, he handed over the spirit."
"19:31"	"Now since it was preparation day, in order that the bodies might not remain on the cross on the sabbath, for the sabbath day of that week was a solemn one, the Jews asked Pilate that their legs be broken and they be taken down."
"19:32"	"So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first and then of the other one who was crucified with Jesus."
"19:33"	"But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs,"
"19:34"	"but one soldier thrust his lance into his side, and immediately blood and water flowed out."
"19:35"	"An eyewitness has testified, and his testimony is true; he knows that he is speaking the truth, so that you also may (come to) believe."
"19:36"	"For this happened so that the scripture passage might be fulfilled: ""Not a bone of it will be broken."""
"19:37"	"And again another passage says: ""They will look upon him whom they have pierced."""
"19:38"	"After this, Joseph of Arimathea, secretly a disciple of Jesus for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate if he could remove the body of Jesus. And Pilate permitted it. So he came and took his body."
"19:39"	"Nicodemus, the one who had first come to him at night, also came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes weighing about one hundred pounds."
"19:40"	"They took the body of Jesus and bound it with burial cloths along with the spices, according to the Jewish burial custom."
"19:41"	"Now in the place where he had been crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb, in which no one had yet been buried."
"19:42"	"So they laid Jesus there because of the Jewish preparation day; for the tomb was close by."
"20:1"	"On the first day of the week, Mary of Magdala came to the tomb early in the morning, while it was still dark, and saw the stone removed from the tomb."
"20:2"	"So she ran and went to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and told them, ""They have taken the Lord from the tomb, and we don't know where they put him."""
"20:3"	"So Peter and the other disciple went out and came to the tomb."
"20:4"	"They both ran, but the other disciple ran faster than Peter and arrived at the tomb first;"
"20:5"	"he bent down and saw the burial cloths there, but did not go in."
"20:6"	"When Simon Peter arrived after him, he went into the tomb and saw the burial cloths there,"
"20:7"	"and the cloth that had covered his head, not with the burial cloths but rolled up in a separate place."
"20:8"	"Then the other disciple also went in, the one who had arrived at the tomb first, and he saw and believed."
"20:9"	"For they did not yet understand the scripture that he had to rise from the dead."
"20:10"	"Then the disciples returned home."
"20:11"	"But Mary stayed outside the tomb weeping. And as she wept, she bent over into the tomb"
"20:12"	"and saw two angels in white sitting there, one at the head and one at the feet where the body of Jesus had been."
"20:13"	"And they said to her, ""Woman, why are you weeping?"" She said to them, ""They have taken my Lord, and I don't know where they laid him."""
"20:14"	"When she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus there, but did not know it was Jesus."
"20:15"	"Jesus said to her, ""Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you looking for?"" She thought it was the gardener and said to him, ""Sir, if you carried him away, tell me where you laid him, and I will take him."""
"20:16"	"Jesus said to her, ""Mary!"" She turned and said to him in Hebrew, ""Rabbouni,"" which means Teacher."
"20:17"	"Jesus said to her, ""Stop holding on to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go to my brothers and tell them, 'I am going to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.'"""
"20:18"	"Mary of Magdala went and announced to the disciples, ""I have seen the Lord,"" and what he told her."
"20:19"	"On the evening of that first day of the week, when the doors were locked, where the disciples were, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in their midst and said to them, ""Peace be with you."""
"20:20"	"When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his side. The disciples rejoiced when they saw the Lord."
"20:21"	"(Jesus) said to them again, ""Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, so I send you."""
"20:22"	"And when he had said this, he breathed on them and said to them, ""Receive the holy Spirit."
"20:23"	"Whose sins you forgive are forgiven them, and whose sins you retain are retained."""
"20:24"	"Thomas, called Didymus, one of the Twelve, was not with them when Jesus came."
"20:25"	"So the other disciples said to him, ""We have seen the Lord."" But he said to them, ""Unless I see the mark of the nails in his hands and put my finger into the nailmarks and put my hand into his side, I will not believe."""
"20:26"	"Now a week later his disciples were again inside and Thomas was with them. Jesus came, although the doors were locked, and stood in their midst and said, ""Peace be with you."""
"20:27"	"Then he said to Thomas, ""Put your finger here and see my hands, and bring your hand and put it into my side, and do not be unbelieving, but believe."""
"20:28"	"Thomas answered and said to him, ""My Lord and my God!"""
"20:29"	"Jesus said to him, ""Have you come to believe because you have seen me? Blessed are those who have not seen and have believed."""
"20:30"	"Now Jesus did many other signs in the presence of (his) disciples that are not written in this book."
"20:31"	"But these are written that you may (come to) believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that through this belief you may have life in his name."
"21:1"	"After this, Jesus revealed himself again to his disciples at the Sea of Tiberias. He revealed himself in this way."
"21:2"	"Together were Simon Peter, Thomas called Didymus, Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, Zebedee's sons, and two others of his disciples."
"21:3"	"Simon Peter said to them, ""I am going fishing."" They said to him, ""We also will come with you."" So they went out and got into the boat, but that night they caught nothing."
"21:4"	"When it was already dawn, Jesus was standing on the shore; but the disciples did not realize that it was Jesus."
"21:5"	"Jesus said to them, ""Children, have you caught anything to eat?"" They answered him, ""No."""
"21:6"	"So he said to them, ""Cast the net over the right side of the boat and you will find something."" So they cast it, and were not able to pull it in because of the number of fish."
"21:7"	"So the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, ""It is the Lord."" When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he tucked in his garment, for he was lightly clad, and jumped into the sea."
"21:8"	"The other disciples came in the boat, for they were not far from shore, only about a hundred yards, dragging the net with the fish."
"21:9"	"When they climbed out on shore, they saw a charcoal fire with fish on it and bread."
"21:10"	"Jesus said to them, ""Bring some of the fish you just caught."""
"21:11"	"So Simon Peter went over and dragged the net ashore full of one hundred fifty-three large fish. Even though there were so many, the net was not torn."
"21:12"	"Jesus said to them, ""Come, have breakfast."" And none of the disciples dared to ask him, ""Who are you?"" because they realized it was the Lord."
"21:13"	"Jesus came over and took the bread and gave it to them, and in like manner the fish."
"21:14"	"This was now the third time Jesus was revealed to his disciples after being raised from the dead."
"21:15"	"When they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, ""Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?"" He said to him, ""Yes, Lord, you know that I love you."" He said to him, ""Feed my lambs."""
"21:16"	"He then said to him a second time, ""Simon, son of John, do you love me?"" He said to him, ""Yes, Lord, you know that I love you."" He said to him, ""Tend my sheep."""
"21:17"	"He said to him the third time, ""Simon, son of John, do you love me?"" Peter was distressed that he had said to him a third time, ""Do you love me?"" and he said to him, ""Lord, you know everything; you know that I love you."" (Jesus) said to him, ""Feed my sheep."
"21:18"	"Amen, amen, I say to you, when you were younger, you used to dress yourself and go where you wanted; but when you grow old, you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will dress you and lead you where you do not want to go."""
"21:19"	"He said this signifying by what kind of death he would glorify God. And when he had said this, he said to him, ""Follow me."""
"21:20"	"Peter turned and saw the disciple following whom Jesus loved, the one who had also reclined upon his chest during the supper and had said, ""Master, who is the one who will betray you?"""
"21:21"	"When Peter saw him, he said to Jesus, ""Lord, what about him?"""
"21:22"	"Jesus said to him, ""What if I want him to remain until I come? What concern is it of yours? You follow me."""
"21:23"	"So the word spread among the brothers that that disciple would not die. But Jesus had not told him that he would not die, just ""What if I want him to remain until I come? (What concern is it of yours?)"""
"21:24"	"It is this disciple who testifies to these things and has written them, and we know that his testimony is true."
"21:25"	"There are also many other things that Jesus did, but if these were to be described individually, I do not think the whole world would contain the books that would be written."
